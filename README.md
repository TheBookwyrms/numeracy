a math library written in rust, with some linear algebra capabilities

to-do list:
- read through code to find relations, and what type restrictions are needed where, then simplify
- write tests
- write documentation
- ArbitraryPrecisionNumber + OperationTree
- finish adding material from linear algebra course
- add statistics stuff
- trigonometry
- add solution set for infinite solutions gauss/gauss-jordan elimination
